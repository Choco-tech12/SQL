#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

2. How many orders in January were iPhones?
SELECT COUNT(Product) as iPhones
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
;
OR

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

3. Select the customers with account numbers that ordered in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

4. What is the lowest priced item that sold in January? What was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
;

5. What was the overall revenue made by each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
;

6. What product(s) were sold, and how much revenue was made at the address 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101 on February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
;

7. Select the customer accounts that bought more than 2 items and the average payment made.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity >2
;
