#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

2. How many orders in January were iPhones?
SELECT COUNT(Product) as iPhones
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
;
OR

SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

3. Select the customers with account numbers that ordered in February.
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

4. What is the lowest priced item that sold in January? What was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
;

5. What was the overall revenue made by each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
;

6. What product(s) were sold, and how much revenue was made at the address 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101 on February?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
;

7. Select the customer accounts that bought more than 2 items and the average payment made.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity >2
;

8. Find the address where the order date matches 02/18/19 at 01:35.
SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35'
;

9. How many orders were made on February 18th, 2019?
SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%'
;

10. Show a list of orders made between February 13th, 2019 through February 18th, 2019.
SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00'
;

11. In March, find the order ID(s) that starts with '16', any number followed by a 0, then followed by any number(s) after.
SELECT orderID
FROM BIT_DB.MarSales
WHERE orderID LIKE '16_0%'
;

12. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product, SUM (Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product
;

13. What was the average amount spent per account in February?  
SELECT SUM (quantity*price)/COUNT (customers.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

14. Find order ids from Georgia (GA) where the order has an average price greater than $1,000. Only find orders from dates beginning with ‘04/1’. Assume that the dates are stored in the MM/DD/YY HH:MM format.
SELECT orderid
FROM BIT_DB.AprSales
WHERE location LIKE '%GA%'
AND orderdate LIKE '04/1%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY orderid
HAVING AVG (price) > 1000
;

15. You’ve been given the following results from the MaySales table. Can you reverse engineer a SQL query that returns these results?
SELECT location, orderid
FROM BIT_DB.MaySales
WHERE orderid LIKE '1943_5'
AND length (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

16. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, SUM (quantity*price) total
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
